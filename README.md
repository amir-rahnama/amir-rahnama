## Hey Everyone! 👋  

I’m **Amir Rahnama** — a machine learning engineer, working with **deep learning and large language models**.  

Right now, I’m a **Senior ML Engineer at AllEars**, building cool things with AI. Before that, I worked at Capgemini (also as Senior ML engineer) here in Stockholm, Sweden, did a PhD in ML at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm)**, and even spent some time as a research intern at Spotify 🎶.  

### A few things about me:
- 🤖 Currently geeking out over **how LLMs reason, interpret text, and sometimes hallucinate**  
- 📚 Love digging into the *theory vs. practice* gap in ML  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I switched fields three times at uni — **Mathematics ➡️ Information Technology ➡️ AI**
